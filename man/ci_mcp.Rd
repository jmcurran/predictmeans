\title{Multiple Comparisons Based on the Confidence Intervals}
\usage{
ci_mcp(LL, UL, trt_n = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{LL}{Lower limits of treatments' confidence interval.}

\item{UL}{Upper limits of treatments' confidence interval.}

\item{trt_n}{Treatments' names.}
}
\description{
This function produces letter representations for a multiple comparison test
by analyzing the confidence intervals associated with the mean values of
different treatments. In particular, if the confidence intervals of two
treatments overlap, it indicates that there is no significant difference
between them. Conversely, if the confidence intervals do not overlap, it
indicates that the treatments are significantly different from each other.
