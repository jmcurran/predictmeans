\description{
\code{ATP} containing data from an experiment to study the effects of
preserving liquids on the enzyme content of dog hearts. There were 23 hearts
and two treatment factors, A and B, each at two levels. Measurements were

hourly intervals during a twelve hour period following initial preservation.
